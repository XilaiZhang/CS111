the terminal mode.

other information:
I noticed something about the test script and posted a question on Piazza, see
question@99.
I also noticed something about the linux server and posted a note on Piazza
, see note@113.
Also, to avoid warning about using kill. I added another include line at the
top of my source code.

I read the Linux man page for termios, tcgetattr, tcsetattr,fork,waitpid,exec,
pipe,kill strerror,poll. And TA BU ZHAOXING also talked about a lot of APIs 
in class. And he showed us the gnu library page for noncanonical mode.
