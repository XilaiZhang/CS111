The lab1b-client.c and lab1b-server.c, after compilation,
will set up a communication through socket. And the server is also connected
to a shell. The compress option allows compressed data to be transmitted 
between the client and the server. Makefile can make with different options.

I have spent a lot of time debugging, and by now, I finally figured out
why I fail the compressed SENT commands test in the sanity check. 
Basically the test script checks the content against the log, and under
compress option, the content in the log should all be in compressed form.
Previously I thought they are readable characters and thus wasted a lot
of time. A previous bug that I figured out which took me three days:
 I forgot to put break after one of the case statement. I also posted a 
question on Piazza that asks about waitpid issue: see question @171,
but it turned out that this bug had nothing to do with waitpid. It was
because I forgot the break, so one of the pipe is always closed before
transmission is complete. Bad debugging strategy makes me pay the price
of 1 slip day.

The sources I used are the tutorials link the professor posted and the sample
code the TA gave during discussion session.
