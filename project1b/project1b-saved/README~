I am running out of time and I do not want to use slip day so this will be 
a short readme. The lab1b-client.c and lab1b-server.c, after compilation,
will set up a communication through socket. And the server is also connected
to a shell.Makefile can make with different options.

I have spent a lot of time debugging, and by now, I still have not figured out
why I fail the compressed SENT commands test in the sanity check. I figured
out a previous bug that took me three days because I forgot to put break after
one of the case statement. 

The sources I used are the tutorials link the professor posted and the sample
code the TA gave during discussion session.
